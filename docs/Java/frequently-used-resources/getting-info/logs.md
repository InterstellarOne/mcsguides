The most common issues will require getting a log for more detailed information. MinecraftHopper guides will detail this process.

The pages reccomend uploading logs to https://paste.gg for viewing, but as an alternative, https://pastebook.dev can also be used. https://mclo.gs is also very useful for viewing logs as it has automatic error higlighting and personal information obfuscation, but it is unfortunately blocked in the Official Minecraft Discord.

## [ðŸ“˜ Crash Report](https://minecrafthopper.net/help/guides/getting-minecraft-crash-report/)
- Useful in determining why Minecraft has crashed. In the case that a crash report doesn't help or isn't available, try to get a latest log or a launcher log instead.

## [ðŸ“˜ Launcher Log](https://minecrafthopper.net/help/guides/getting-minecraft-launcher-log/)
- The launcher log contains history from when the launcherer is started up until the game is closed. It is by far the most comprehensive log that Minecraft produces.

## [ðŸ“˜ Latest Log](https://minecrafthopper.net/help/guides/getting-minecraft-latest-log/)
- The latest log keeps logs of game events from when the game starts until it closes.

## [ðŸ“˜ JVM Crash Report](https://minecrafthopper.net/help/guides/getting-minecraft-jvm-crash-report/)
- Sometimes that java runtime will throw an error that will cause Minecraft to exit unexpectedly. When that happens, a JVM crash report will be generated in the Minecraft data folder, and is often helpful to pinpoint what caused the Java error and how to fix it.
